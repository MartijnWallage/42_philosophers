# 42 Philosophers

A number of philosophers sit around a table, each with a bowl of spaghetti and just one fork in front of them.
However, they absolutely refuse to eat with just one fork.
They are only able to start eating their spaghetti when they have *two* forks.
(Don't ask why.
I guess forks to them are what chopsticks are to the less philosophically inclined.)
So, unfazed by questions of hygiene, they eat when they manage to get of the fork of their left or right neighbour, as well as of their own fork, of course, which is ever in danger of being taken by one of those neighbours.
After they are done eating, they sleep, and when they're done eating, they think until they can get hold of two forks again.
If they don't eat in time, they die.
What policy for taking forks should they think up so that none of them die?
They never talk to each other.
